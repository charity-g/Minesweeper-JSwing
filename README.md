# My Personal Project

### **Task 1** - Project Idea

### **Task 2** - Project proposal
**What will the application do?** <br>
It will be able to simulate, track and allow a user to play a game of minesweeper. 

**Who will use it?** <br>
Anyone who wants to play minesweeper.
 
**Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
Minesweeper was a game my mom really liked to play when I was a kid- she called it a "smart" game where it would force 
your brian into being strategetic and smart about your moves so it has a lot of cool memories for me.


### **Task 3** - User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to start a new blank game and thus add multiple squares that are bombs to a 
  list of squares
- As a user, I want to be able to flag a tile
- As a user, I want to be able to unearth a tile(multiple) and see what state it is below
- As a user, I want to be able to unearth a whole bunch of tiles if the tile I have pressed is blank
- As a user, I want to be able to have the ability to click on a bomb and end game
- As a user, I want to be able to win the game once I have unearthed all the non-bomb tiles
- As a user, I want to be able to save the game I am playing down to the state of each square on the board 
- As a user, I want to be able to load a game exactly where I left it off, and continue making moves.
