# My Personal Project

### **Task 1** - Project Idea
A club equipment storage tracker

### **Task 2** - Project proposal
**What will the application do?** <br>
It will be able to track equipment type, categorize them in general subgroups, track who takes them
out and who adds them(by who I mean which working group and what purposes).

**Who will use it?** <br>
The club's internal organization.
 
**Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
I personally have become frustrated at obe of the club's organization strategies for equipment handling- 
ie: the solution is to shove it in a box in the storage closet and leave it there.
So when I found that we were re-buying stuff we technically already had in store, 
I wished we had a way of easily knowing what was already taken. Because we are also using club money, I wanted to be
more efficient and accountable with it.


### **Task 3** - User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add an item in storage
- As a user, I want to be able to search for an item in storage, whether we have it or not
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from storage
- As a user, I want to be able to see the list of all items in storage
- As a user, I want to be able to see the list of items in their sub-categories
- As a user I want to be able to have multiple items of the same type in storage
- As a user I want to be able to remove an item from storage, but not have to take all of one item
